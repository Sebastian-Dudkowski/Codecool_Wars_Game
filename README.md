# Codecool_Wars_Game
Simple dungeon crawl style game written in Java using SceneBuilder for display. 
It's a kind of dungeon crawler game in which we control a character that can fight enemies which are moving autonomously on a seperate thread. 
The view is centered around the player and we can perform different actions like, picking up items, opening doors, and healing.
